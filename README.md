# Immersive VR Experience for Heritage Education

## 📌 Project Overview
The *Immersive VR Experience for Heritage Education* project is a Virtual Reality (VR)–based educational application designed to enable students to explore an Indian heritage monument through a realistic, interactive, and historically accurate virtual field trip.  
The project digitally reconstructs the **Konark Sun Temple** and allows learners to experience its architectural scale, spatial layout, and historical significance in an immersive VR environment.

This project was developed as an **industry-aligned academic project** in collaboration with **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design and develop an immersive VR educational application that:
- Enhances heritage education beyond textbooks and 2D media
- Provides interactive and engaging virtual field trips
- Maintains historical accuracy and architectural authenticity
- Ensures user comfort and performance optimization for VR devices

---

## 📚 Problem Statement
Traditional heritage education relies on textbooks, images, and videos that fail to convey spatial depth, scale, and cultural atmosphere. Physical field trips are often limited by cost, accessibility, and safety concerns.  
There is a need for an **immersive, scalable, and interactive solution** that can deliver realistic heritage learning experiences while preserving historical accuracy.
